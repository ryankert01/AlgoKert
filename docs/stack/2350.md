## Intuition

Define `round` to be some sort of range, all numbers form `1 to k` is found in this round.
Loop through `rolls`, try to find the last round, and answer is `round+1`.
So, we use stack to ignore possible duplicate numbers, and if `stack.size() == k` , we know we find all the numbers.
Therefore, we clear the stack, and go to another round.

## Code

```cpp
int shortestSequence(vector<int>& rolls, int k) {
	unordered_set<int>st;
	int res = 1;
	for(auto& i : rolls) {
		st.insert(i);
		if(st.size() == k) {
			st.clear();
			res++;
		}
	}
	return res;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

**Time:** `O(n)`
**Space:** `O(n)`
